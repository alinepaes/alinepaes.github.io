I am an Associate Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the <a href="https://www.ic.uff.br/"> Institute of Computing </a> of <a href="https://www.uff.br/"> Universidade Federal Fluminense (UFF), located in the cosy city of <a href="https://g.co/kgs/4Gt8DdR"> Niter√≥i </a>, RJ, Brazil. I am a permanent member of the Graduate Program in Computer Science at IC/UFF, where I lead the Machine Learning and Language Learning <a href="https://github.com/MeLLL-UFF">(MeLLL-UFF) </a>research group. I hold a DS.C and M.S. degrees in Systems Engineering and Computer Science from COPPE/UFRJ and a B.S. in Computer Science from IME/UERJ. During my D.Sc. studies, I was a visiting scholar at Imperial College London for a year. I have a productivity research grant level E from CNPq and a young scientist research grant from FAPERJ. In 2023, I was a visiting professor in the NLP group of the University of Sheffield for three months with a CAPES-PRINT scholarship. 

I am a member of the Brazilian Computer Society (SBC) and its special commission in NLP <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ce-pln/inicio"> (CE-PLN) </a> and the National Institute of AI (IAIA). I am also a member of the <a href ="https://brasileiraspln.com/"> Brazilian Women in NLP group (Brasileiras em PLN)</a>. Check out our first free and online <a href="https://brasileiraspln.com/livro-pln/"> book </a> about NLP in Portuguese. 

My recent research has primarily focused on relational  machine learning, machine learning for natural language processing, and AI for positive social impact. Currently, I am interested on:
 - Language Models and Generative AI (like anyone else)
 - Knowledge-enhanced ML for NLP
 - Low-resource ML for NLP
 - Figurative Language
 - Text simplification
 - Generative AI for Financial Assets Analyses
 - NLP for Brazilian Indigenous Languages
 - Transfer Learning for Statistical Relational Models
 - Detection of lousy behavior like hate speech, gender bias, and persuasion for negative manipulation.
